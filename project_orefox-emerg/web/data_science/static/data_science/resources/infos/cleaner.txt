Handle Inequalities - Cells with < or > at the beginning of them cannot be directly used in analysis, so this will remove the cells, setting them either to the figure after them or to zero in the < case.

Convert Uniform Units - For all columns that are in percent, ppm or ppb, this will convert them all to the same unit.

Remove Columns - Deletes columns from the dataset.

Remove Entries - Deletes rows from the dataset.

Impute Data - Fills in numerical data that is missing, using a variety of methods. Can choose from zero, average crustal abundance, median, mean and multiple imputation with chained equations.
