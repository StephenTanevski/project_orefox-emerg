Random forests are an ensemble learning method that can be used to solve regression and classification tasks. This method works by constructing a variety of decision trees at training time and returning either the mean prediction in the case of regression tasks, or the mode of classes in the case of a classifcation problem. They are a popular method for analysis compared to some other methods because they do not overfit to the training data.
