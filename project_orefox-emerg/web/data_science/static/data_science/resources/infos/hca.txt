Hierarchical clustering analysis is a clustering method that creates a heirarchy of clusters. There are toe main approaches to this analysis, agglomerative (done here) which is a bottom-up approach, and divisive which is a top-down approach. Whether or not two data points are considered close or far are defined by the distance metric. Here the Euclidean distance is used which is like drawing a straight line in the feature space between the two points.
