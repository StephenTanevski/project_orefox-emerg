Principle component analysis involves taking a numerical dataset and performing a change of basis on it to translate the data into another space. Each dimension of this new space defines a principle component, and each principle component is the best fit it can be to the data, while still being 'perpendicular' (in the highly dimensional PCA space) to all of the previous components. A PCA can be used to reduce the dimensionality of the data, removing the least impactful pricinple components and performing further analysing in the PCA space rather than the original feature space.
